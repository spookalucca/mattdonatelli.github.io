Hi, my name is Spookalucca. I'm an independent game developer making spooky immersive games. After over a decade of helping bring other people's game ideas to life, I've decided to set out an make my own.

I'm still working on my debut game title, but if you're interested in getting behind-the-scenes details about it, please consider supporting me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/spookalucca). 

If you'd like to be notified about this debut title, sign up for my Newsletter below. I promise I won't spam your inbox :3
