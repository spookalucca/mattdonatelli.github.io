After months of preparation, I'm launching my Patreon and overall web presence for my horror video game creation business. I've got a partner in crime who will be collaborating on narrative, but I'm doing almost everything else in the gamedev department! 

Patreon supporters will receive a lot of benefits, some immediate, some more long term as we ship our first game! Patrons will get a free copy of every game they support, their name in the credits, and access to our Patron-Only Discord server, which comes with a host of benefits which you can check out over on the Patreon page. 

Consider supporting me: [https://patreon.com/spookalucca](https://patreon.com/spookalucca)

*I hope to be spooking you very soon!*
